========

1.0+ Initial version: 

2.0+ Additional functionalities:

    This is was the best tested version so far. It was only superseeded because of commercialization of PySimpleGui library.

4.0+ Kivy:

    Version 4.0 replaces PySimpleGui with Kivy. This version currently lacks some functionality of 2.0 because new UI related difficulties. For instance only singular materials can currently be applied.
