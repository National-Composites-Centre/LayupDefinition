Developer Guide
===============

To some extend LayupDefinition development has been superceeded by CompoST standard.

This library can still  be used to create CompoST layup definitions, but the main goal is to develop interfaces for other OS and OTS software to export into CompoST.

The main purpose of LD going forward is to serve as OS testbench for CompoST development down the line from design.
