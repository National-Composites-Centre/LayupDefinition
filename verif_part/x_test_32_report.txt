             WARNINGS:  

Bolt diameter to laminate thickness ratio (d/t) should be around 1.
This ratio is 6.666666666666667 at the hole location [210.132105   60.         84.7469815].
Please adjust this if this hole is used for bolted connection.

If GRP involved in the stack is over 1mm, check the attenuation charts for your specific frequency used at :https://nationalcompositescentre.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/NCC-CoSinC85/EdLNWUUuXDNLj6UFZSBgDHoB0RAMPedN4cfktxJb563r1Q?e=yAWqAN.
 

             SUGGESTED CHECKS: 

 The layup has less than 10 percent 90 degree plies in location delimited by spline: 'Circle.6'.
To avoid excessive thermal expansion more 90 degree plies should be used.

 The layup has less than 10 percent 90 degree plies in location delimited by spline: Edge of part.
To avoid excessive thermal expansion more 90 degree plies should be used.

The layup around hole located at [210.132105   60.         84.7469815] has 100% layers oriented  in 0.0 direction. If the structure is mechanically fastened, an excess of 40% of the fibres oriented in any one direction is inadvisable.

 The layup contains group of 4 or more plies grouped together in location delimited by spline: 'Circle.6'.
This should be avoided.

 The layup contains group of 4 or more plies grouped together in location delimited by spline: Edge of part.
This should be avoided.

Drop-off at one location should not exceed 0.25mm for unidirectional and 0.38 for woven fabric.The drop-off is 0.30000000000000004mm at Edge of part.


Outermost plies should typically be +45° or –45° .
